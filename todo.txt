                -- Recipe Node + Express API --

- create docker files for prod
- seeding: create mongodb user and role
- eventually migrate express app to typescript nestjs app


              - Security-Related -
- implement roles instead of isAdmin boolean flag
- create validation schemas for users for logins and sign ups
- possibly use built-in escape function for passwords as well
- add a re-authentication process on edit users confirmation for admin request
- add a match-to regex in model level authentication for mongoose for passwords (just doing it for the experience, unneeded in application)
- implement validation to make sure recipe titles are unique


  -- Shared --
- find better way to 'log to console' for heroku or remote environments in general (heroku different from aws lamba in terms of stdout?)
- start to implement testing
- implement password resets (for users & admin)
- possibly email just ingredients or something
- implement pagination for recipe search page and recipe list page
